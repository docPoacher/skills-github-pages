  I **intensely dislike** typing the date on these blog posts.  It is crippling.  

  todo:
  - what is "gemfile"?
  - https://github.com/zivhub/monophase might have it
  - the theme is good, too
  - i will die if themes are just css

What else *can* i do with this stuff?  

Another thing I dislike is the auto complete not causing the cursor to jump after tab

<table><tr><td>what do I do here? press end?  I need to leave home row for it and its aggrevating.</td></tr></table>

there must be an alternative.
