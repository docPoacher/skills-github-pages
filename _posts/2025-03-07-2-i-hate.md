  I **intensely dislike** typing the date on these blog posts.  It is crippling.  

  todo:
  - what is "gemfile"?
  - https://github.com/zivhub/monophase might have it
  - the theme is good, too
  - [actually, this probably has the answer](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/)  
  - i will die if themes are just css
  - https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/unclear-how-to-access-the-gemfile-on-github-pages/7425/4 i dunono
  - this is quite aggrevating  

What else *can* i do with this stuff?  

Another thing I dislike is the auto complete not causing the cursor to jump after tab

<table><tr><td>what do I do here? press end?  I need to leave home row for it and its aggrevating.</td></tr></table>

there must be an alternative.
